## Reanalysis of Kirsh's 23-08-27 survey

Steve Kirsh ran a survey on # of COVID infections and [advertised it on his substack](https://kirschsubstack.com/p/how-many-times-have-you-had-covid). Steve then published his analysis and [made the full dataset available](https://airtable.com/appcRtVQP2AblbiWD/shrfWf7WyJsXS8cxV/tblTbdsvLJWU0dIWu).

Steve claimed vaxxed were over 2X more likely to get COVID than the unvaxxed.

That was not a true claim for a couple reasons:

He compares the "general vax compliance" numbers instead of the COVID vax compliance numbers. They are not equivalent but he uses the phrase "the vaccine" which muddles things. 

He included "No Answer". "No Answer" doesn't mean "0".

He compared the “No vaccines at all” vs. the “High” and “Very high” groups. He didn't compare “No vaccines at all” vs. any % vaccine

General issues with survey interpretation as clarified below.

After going through his data, the vaxxed (for COVID) and tested participants reported an avg of 1.1 cases while the unvaxxed and tested reported an avg of 1.2 cases. This has the vaxxed about 10% less likely to get COVID than the unvaxxed. 

Even if you look at "any general vax" compaired to "no general vax", in participants who mentioned testing and not testing, the average # of cases was nearly identical. There was a difference in the averages of less than 0.01 cases...

Participants who tested reported 1.6x more covid cases than untested.

### Steve Kirsh did his analysis at 16736; so will I. 

To start at the beginning,

>How many separate COVID injections did you take?

was not a required answer. 

>How many TOTAL times have you had COVID? If you cannot remember, pick the closest number to what you recall

was also not a required answer. 

25 people removed for not recording how many times they had C19. 
>885, 969, 1181, 1538, 2149, 5668, 5925, 6281, 7721, 9333, 9370, 9844, 10050, 10973, 12069, 12075, 12381, 12670, 12814, 12860, 14761, 14916, 15376, 15388, 16029


What does “have you had COVID” mean? 

As 1538 puts it:
>I cannot answer the 'how many times have I had COVID?' question meaningfully, as (a) the symptoms that 'define' it are too subjective and overlap with 'flu/colds too much, so I do not know how accurately to distinguish it and (b) the PCR/LFD tests have no scientific basis for them.  I had one period of illness Dec 2019 which had some unusual symptoms and 3 or 4 other cold-type illnesses which I cannot tell were 'COVID' or not.

I cannot speak to the accuracy or lack thereof for the PCR/LFD.

43 people removed for not recording how many times they had separate COVID injections. 
>460, 551, 647, 790, 1196, 1217, 1613, 2058, 3319, 3442, 3511, 4662, 4721, 5095, 5214, 5518, 5839, 6337, 6597, 7010, 7329, 7391, 7687, 7852, 7969, 8296, 8476, 8591, 8707, 8812, 9009, 9386, 10028, 10118, 10747, 11164, 11558, 11719, 12586, 12621, 13453, 14003, 14409

Also, this is not a representative sample of the population.
As 6597 puts it:
>...I used to clean your carpets…

Who are the sorts of people who respond to a Steve Kirsh survey?

9954 people wrote notes.

2526 people mentioned testing. As 31 says:
>I wouldn't have known I had Covid except for the fact that I had to test. I stopped testing after that.

## Asymptomatic covid

Also 16:
>Barely even knew I had it. Only aware cause those around me were sicker and testing

61 is a little aggravating. 
>I show I have covid antibodies but I never tested positive or ever felt sick like I had covid.  So I must have had it at some point, but never was aware I ever had it.

That sure sounds like they had covid at least once if the antibody test is to be believed, but they didn’t mark that they had covid even a single time. Antibody test +, No symptoms, Marked 0 cases

76 is another reason not to believe this data:
>As far as I’m concerned it’s just the seasonal flu. No big deal. I only tested due to the insistence of a paranoid roommate I had at the time.

They marked having covid 4 times, but not only is it unclear if they ever had covid as opposed to the flu it is also unclear if the test result for covid was even positive.

## Symptomatic

281 says
>Might have had Covid in January 20 20. This was before it was announced. The symptoms were unlike anything I’ve ever had in my 74 years was tested for antibodies but had none for months later.

They didn’t mark that they had covid even a single time. They had the symptoms but the antibody test was negative. Antibody test -, Symptoms, Marked 0 cases

108 said
>Twice, I have had COVID like symptoms, but tested negative both times.

114 said
>I have never taken a Covid test so I don’t know if I officially had Covid. However, in late 2021 I have a bad cold, resulting in losing my sense of smell.

And marked that they did not have covid

And 128 said 
>I BELIEVE I had Covid. I never took a test. I had loss of smell & taste which I had never experienced before so I assumed it was Covid. I was also in close contact to a family member who DID test positive for it.

And marked that they did have covid

190 marked that they had covid once but said:
>Only one positive covid test, but based on the gut dysbiosis after an infection months before, I may have had it then also.  Both times treated with IVM and other FLCCC protocol, but the November infection (tested positive at the ER b/c home test was negative so thought it was influenza) left me with long-covid which I continue to treat.

Hard to interpret this

347 marked that they had not had covid but that
>I had an antibody test that came back positive once but I've never been sick.


578:
>How would anyone KNOW they had covid? 1) the PCR test is bogus, as Kerry Mullis made clear before his untimely death; 2) after reading/watching Dr. Samantha and Mark Bailey's and colleagues work, one must conclude there are no viruses--or alternatively refute them. 

341 displays an issue with this my rather simple method of searching through the notes for instances of test as they come up from “latest”. Along with false positives like this, there are sure to be false negatives, such as if someone said they “verified through antigen” for example would not contain the word test. They also highlight a key shortcoming of the survey What does vax level even mean?:
>I’m 54 years old, so I have had whatever childhood vaccines were typically given in that era/at that time. I haven’t taken the shingles vaccine or any of the la**test** recommendations for middle aged people. 

1063 marked that they are .25 vaccinated but said:
Not "vaccinated" growing up but unfortunately having joined the U.S. Army I received a whole slew of them upon enlistment (~1997) and received the 1st of a 5 shot Anthrax "vaccine" series while in Afghanistan…

393 kills me. Marked that they had c19 but says:
>I've been exposed - spent weekends with - family and friends who tested positive for COVID yet never got it.

1090 helps elucidate the issues with claiming efficacy of any particular protocol:
>I stopped testing for covid in 2022, so I could have had it. But I got well quickly using Dayquil and Nyquil.

1106 on the efficacy of the testing after they marked that they never had covid:
>However, this comes with a caveat. The whole family got ill around the same time in early summer of 2022.  It felt like flu to me - fever, body aches, headache, and exhausted for 2 days - though two family members had sore throats and lingering coughs, but I had neither of those symptoms.  I was back on my feet after a few days and just tired but pretty much better after about a week.  We all got positive tests on Covid Rapid Antigen Tests (my son wanted us to test). However, my partner took an antibody test for Covid a month or so afterwards (just to see) and it came back negative. Left us all scratching ours heads as to whether the RAT are not very discriminatory or rubbish or the Covid antibody test was useless. Many people in our city were testing positive using the same RA tests around the same time (within a month or two) so also may have not had Covid - but that is what the city was calling it and totting up the numbers!  So that is why I said zero - though it may have been once if the antibody test was wrong - but I can't really say for sure. 

1146 marked that they were NOT generally vaccinated at all 0% but said:
>Re. past vaccine compliance, I had all the normal childhood shots that someone born in the 60s would have had, but haven’t had any in the last 12 years. Turned down the DTP booster at last checkup. Have never taken a flu or pneumonia shot. Not planning on ever taking another vaccine.  I might have had Covid again (most recently, potentially, a few weeks ago) but we stopped testing after March 2022, which was the last time my husband and I had it/tested. It just presents as a cold. 

1234 marked they were 25-75% generally vaxxed but said: 
>I was born 1961 so had only a few vaccines as a child. As an adult, until 2020 I received many vaccines recommended for international travel, including measles and yellow fever -- except flu vaccine, which my doctor said was not effective. Once I saw the nonsensical fervor over the untested COVID vaccines, I stopped accepting any vaccines, and never will. I am skeptical now even of Advil and Tylenol.

1378 marked <25% generally vaxxed and highlighted another issue relating to locality:
>Lateral Flow test suggested I had C-19. Had mild symptoms - was in bed for 1.5 days, ‘fragile for about 5 days and then back at work on day 7. Took Quercetin, Zinc, high dose Vit C 
Your question on General vaccines is not clear! I live in the UK am 65 years old and we have far fewer vaccines than in the USA … at least when I grew up in the 1960s! 

1824 wrote they had c19 0 times and:
>Aug 2021 high fever, 104° nursed it myself with 5000-6000mg vit C and tylenol 800mg (hate tylenol but only way to get fever lower) but had faint pink blotches that traveled from neck to legs hmm. So 2 days after fever dropped went to Urgent care- covid test neg- I said could this be LYME?  Doc didn’t want fo beleve it. I argued finally he ordered bloodtest- It Was Lyme Disease.

What the heck does this have to do about c19 and vaccines???????

>When I had a cold or was sick I never tested myself for Covid. I know I had it by symptoms.  At the time (2021) total loss of taste and smell. I feel too many people will reply they had Covid many times due to testing which we all know is not reliable, gives high false positives, and was used to usher in lockdowns and restrictions. People I know still run out and get a Covid test for a sniffle. And it will say Covid. And I think it is total bs 

2044 says they have had covid 6 or more times and writes that:
>I never tested positive.  My first Covid was in November 2019.  Seattle.  When info first became available of HCQ being effective, my longtime Doctor refused to prescribe it.  Said they were saving it for those who needed it.  I was 67, lost my smell and taste and have had long Covid ever since.

I did not consider this before; folks who have “long covid” may be defining their # of c19 cases in a different way.




I appreciate 2437 who has opposing priors to me. They say:
>I think you need to ask how many times people tested positive for covid, because people might think that if they test positive then that equates to an infection, even though they don’t have symptoms.

2471 demonstrates what I worry leads to resentment and violence (emphasis mine):
>Not sure if I had covid or not…No testing done, but may have had that or Influenza. Only was vaccinated so that I could travel and see grandkids. Would have never gotten vaccine if I could have avoided it.

2478 is a comedian
>The swabs are the culprit  as my dogs dingle berries  tested positive ,,NOT buying into the depop,, stay away from all vaxers

2626 answered that they are at 100% general vax compliance and said:
>I do not get flu or vid shots. All else I have. I generally get a cold/flu maybe once a year. But sometimes not at all. And since the vid is bullcrap, anything I test for they will tell me I have the vid anyway, again which is bullcrap. I take care of myself, don't bother with hospitals, waste of time

3028 alleges an open? conspiracy? By the VA to juice the #s. I do not know the accuracy of these claims:
>the one time I was diagnosed w/ COVID, I went for a second opinion outside of VA system.  That one I tested negative and had to bring that test result back to continue working frontline.
I realized then after talking patients, peers and others at VA (other VA’s as well) that all veterans coming through to get tested, symptoms or not, were to be ‘positive’.  Afterwards, if I needed to be tested, I went outside the VA (oddly, never tested positive).  Also never followed mandates set by the VA w/ any of my patients afterwards.

3312 says claims ulterior motive by docs:
>I had a severe case of gastroenteritis in December, 2021, and eventually ended up in a hospital.  I "tested positive" for covid and was put in the covid ward for ten days.  I never wore a mask and was in a room with two other people who were struggling to breathe and coughing.  I had no respiratory symptoms, and found out later that they wanted to "treat" me with remdesivir, but couldn't justify it due to no respiratory symptoms.

3436 validates my method decision in including people who didn’t test but who had people around them test positive:
>Did not test, but others around me did test


I appreciate the candor of some of the respondents, things like,


>I'm an older broad


>We are both old & fat with the usual health issues.


>I took advantage of my husband bringing my food on a tray (haha)


>I can't be sure that I had covid because obviously I have no interest in being tested for it.  I did try to spread it to my doctor though.


>I was pregnant and could smell EVERYTHING. Then my husband and I got a weird cold and he couldn't move and I couldn't smell (which was a relief at the time).



What do we do with cases like 4087?:
>I did test positive for Covid once on a home test BUT I am part of the EMBARK study at Cedar Sinai and those tests show that I have never had it.

5523 had some great insight:
>In the past 3 years I’ve had 2 colds. Never tested for covid, but always stayed home and away from others in order not to spread whatever it is. Who cares what it is, no one wants to be sick! It irritates me when people who are sick continue to go out in public and declare “it’s ok, I tested negative for covid”. Yeah, but you’re still hacking, sneezing, and sniffling all over the place. GO HOME!!

12258 says:
>Never tested, I hear those swabs are treated with ethylene glycol and possibly have hydrogel or even nanotech on them.

12305 says:
>Never tested with PCR for it's bullshit outcomes. :) LOL. I hope they choke in their taxpayer's paid sticks up their noses.

12577 says:
>I supposedly had been directly exposed multiple times yet never even got symptoms. Red Cross used to test for COVID antibodies and whether you had any of those shots. I never tested positive for antibodies. 
Red Cross still asks about COVID shots but has fallen under the spell of the CDC and announced that it will drop all gendered language. My next donation will total 18 gallons lifetime donations (well, from when they started counting electronically) and will be my last. I will not be party to the destruction of our blood supply.

>I've never tested for c19 but first sickness 2022 than again Feb. 2023 I've never been the same health wise many many LC symptoms as I belong to covid care group /Long Covid Facebook groups.

5225
>Didn't mask all during covid, except for 2 weeks before anyone else was doing it. Then I decided it was bullshit and I wasn't gonna have it anymore. Then everyone else went crazy with the masks and started pointing and hissing at me like the pod-people did in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

>I was tested last year and confirmed to have Covid. I think I had Covid for a second time, about a month ago, although I can't confirm since I wasn't tested this time.
But I had the same symptoms as last year. I don't think it was the flu since the muscle pains were more intense than when I usually get the flu. And the fever was also more consistent with when I had Covid, lasting days longer than when I've had the flu.
There was a difference this year, however. Instead of being sick 10-11 days with Covid as last year, this time I recovered in about 5 days.
Natural immunity 💪 😊
I've always gotten a flu vax every year, but since they will now be mRNA as well as bivalent, I will no longer take any more of those.
I don't trust other vaccines anymore either, in case they try to sneak mRNA in those as well.


5858 questions the possibility of getting covid more than once being common, citing this paper
>I know many people who claim they had covid numerous times, but did they? The home tests were/are garbage and the PCR tests run so many cycles that they have numerous false positives as well.
Did you read the NEJM article about COVID reinfection in Quatar? It raises the question, ""is it even possible to get covid more than once?"" I believe it is rare to get COVID more than once based on that publication. Is it possible to get COVID more than once? Maybe. Is it probable to get covid more than once? I don't believe so.

5892 had a Borat sense of humor - NOT!!!
>I have cold right now.  Should I get an experimental gene therapy injection and disregard all associated risks with the novel, inadequately tested mRNA injections?  I am struggling with this decision. NOT.

5902
>I got covid in 2020 - natural immunity been working since.  My now 17 year old son got Covid when Covid first started, had to stay home from school/hockey (even though he had a positive antibody test) for two weeks when I and his siblings got it in 2020.     My favorite story is that Xmas when everyone got Covid w/ the varient, he was on a bday party bus event when 50% of the bus (mostly all vaccinated) ALL got Covid days later/he did not...including his girlfriend he kissed that night (NOW THAT'S SCIENCE!).
